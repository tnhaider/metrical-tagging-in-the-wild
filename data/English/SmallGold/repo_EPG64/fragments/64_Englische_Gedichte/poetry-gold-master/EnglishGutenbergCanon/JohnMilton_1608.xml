    <head>On His Blindness (1655)</head>
   <lg type='stanza'>
    <l>WHEN I consider how my light is spent</l>
    <l>Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,</l>
    <l>And that one Talent which is death to hide</l>
    <l>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent</l>
       
    <l>To serve therewith my Maker, and present</l>
    <l>My true account, lest He returning chide,</l>
    <l>“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”</l>
    <l>I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent</l>
    
    <l>That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need</l>
    <l>Either man’s work or his own gifts. Who best</l>
    <l>Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state</l>
    
    <l>Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,</l>
    <l>And post o’er land and ocean without rest;</l>
    <l>They also serve who only stand and wait.”</l>
   </lg>

<head>On His Being Arrived to the Age of Twenty-Three” (1631)</head>
<lg type='stanza'>
    <l>HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,</l>
    <l>Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!</l>
    <l>My hasting days fly on with full career,</l>
    <l>But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.</l>
    <l>Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,</l>
    <l>That I to manhood am arrived so near,</l>
    <l>And inward ripeness doth much less appear,</l>
    <l>That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.</l>
    <l>Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,</l>
    <l>It shall be still in strictest measure even</l>
    <l>To that same lot, however mean or high,</l>
    <l>Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,</l>
    <l>All is, if I have grace to use it so,</l>
    <l>As ever in my great Task-master’s eye</l>
</lg>

<lg type='poem' n='3'>
<head>Song on May Morning (1632–33)</head>
    <lg type='stanza'>
    <l>NOW the bright morning-star, Day’s harbinger,</l>
    <l>Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her</l>
    <l>The flowery May, who from her green lap throws</l>
    <l>The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.</l>
    <l>Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire</l>
    <l>Mirth, and youth, and warm desire!</l>
    <l>Woods and groves are of thy dressing;</l>
    <l>Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.</l>
    <l>Thus we salute thee with our early song,</l>
    <l>And welcome thee, and wish thee long.</l>

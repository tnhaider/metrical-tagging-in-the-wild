    <head>I Hear America Singing</head>
<lg type="stanza">
    <l n="47" >I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear ,</l>
    <l n="48" >Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong ,</l>
    <l n="49">The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam ,</l>
    <l n="50">The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work ,</l>
    <l n="51">The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand</l>
    <l n="52">singing on the steamboat deck ,</l>
    <l n="53">The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as</l>
    <l n="54">he stands ,</l>
    <l n="55">The wood-cutter 's song , the ploughboy 's on his way in the morning ,</l>
    <l n="56">or at noon intermission or at sundown ,</l>
    <l n="57">The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work ,</l>
    <l n="58">or of the girl sewing or washing ,</l>
    <l n="59">Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else ,</l>
    <l n="60">The day what belongs to the day — at night the party of young</l>
    <l n="61">fellows , robust , friendly ,</l>
    <l n="62">Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs .</l>

<lg type="poem">
    <head>O Captain! My Captain!</head>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</l>
        <l>The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</l>
        <l>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</l>
        <l>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</l>
        <l>But O heart! heart! heart!</l>
        <l>O the bleeding drops of red,</l>
        <l>Where on the deck my Captain lies,</l>
        <l>Fallen cold and dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</l>
        <l>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,</l>
        <l>For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,</l>
        <l>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</l>
        <l>Here Captain! dear father!</l>
        <l>This arm beneath your head!</l>
        <l>It is some dream that on the deck,</l>
        <l>You’ve fallen cold and dead.</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza">
        <l>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</l>
        <l>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</l>
        <l>The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</l>
        <l>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</l>
        <l>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</l>
        <l>But I with mournful tread,</l>
        <l>Walk the deck my Captain lies,</l>
        <l>Fallen cold and dead.</l>
    </lg>

<lg type="poem">
    <head>A Noiseless Patient Spider</head>
<lg type="stanza">
    <l n="31">A noiseless patient spider ,</l>
    <l n="32">I mark 'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated ,</l>
    <l n="33">Mark 'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding ,</l>
    <l n="34">It launch 'd forth filament , filament , filament out of itself ,</l>
    <l n="35">Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
    <l n="36">And you O my soul where you stand ,</l>
    <l n="37">Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space ,</l>
    <l n="38">Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to</l>
    <l n="39">connect them ,</l>
    <l n="40">Till the bridge you will need be form 'd , till the ductile anchor hold ,</l>
    <l n="41">Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .</l>
